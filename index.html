        <h2 id="history">Old History | Things that happened long time ago</h2>
        <p>
          I was born in 30th December, 1994. As a slip says, this happened in Patan Hospital.
          Patan Hospital is kind of an <i>okay</i> hospital so, I guess proper care was given to me/my mom
          during my birth. I was roughly 2.5 kg at birth.  My childhood was pretty normal, it seems. As per my parents, I did take T.B. medicine for 9 months when I was roughly 3 years old.

        <h2 id="allergy">Allergic to Phenytoin | Discontinued It's Use</h2>
        <p>
          After some weeks from my first attack, I developed some rashes in my body.
          I then consulted same doctor, Dr. Niranjan Acharya and was found allergic to Phenytoin.
          He advised me to consult Dermaetologist and stop  the medication for 1 weeks (or so).
          I did as suggested. I used _______ medicines for 1 weeks for my rashes, and stopped taking phenytoin.
        </p>
        <p>
          After two weeks, <b>I planned to change my regular doctor</b> to Dr. Basanta Panta.
          I told him that I wanted to stop my medication if it was possible to do so.
          The doctor agreed and we discussed that it was not necessary to continue the medication at this stage.
          <b>The medicine (Phenytoin) was stopped</b>. I was prescribed with <i>"Vitamin"</i> (in doctor's word).
        </p>

        <p>
          Before I developed rashes, I did have some unusual feelings occasionally or rarely.
          I also had explained this to my new doctor.
          I was kinda relieved that I would not have to take those medicines now.
        </p>

        <p>
          Unfortunately, I lost the OPD papers from that checkup.

              That morning I had travelled *some* distance in motorbike.

              After the class ended, I was playing a game on my laptop. (<a href="http://www.elderscrolls.com/">Skyrim</a>).
              I was also lightly arguing with students about charging my laptop.
              At that very moment, I had that unusual feeling and dizziness. I then rapidly turned head left and right and fell down with head on the desk.
              I was then taken to the department, where friends were helping me recover by providing Apple juice and <i>Snickers!</i>

            I also have murky visions of the cab, that was used to take me to the hospital. I know that I puked on the way to hospital several times. Anyways, I was admitted to Patan Hospital at around __ (time)

        <p>
          I did an EEG, and the doctor said everything was pretty good. All the reports were normal. He advised me to take <b>Epilex Chrono 500mg</b> (eqv. to Na Valproate 500mg)
          and <b>Clobasm 10mg </b>. I am to revisit the doctor in one month.
        </p>

        <h2 id="around1year">Seizurelss 9 months</h2>
        <p>
          Continued on the meds, saw the doctor every 3 months, and No reports of seizure for 9 months. 
          However, after 10th or 11th (forgot the exact date) month, had *some* episodes of what I think as "Myoclonic seizure"
          (Do not know if my both parts twitched or only one - at one episode, I went rounds) . It might have been "partial seizure"
          (Need to say this specifics on my next visit to doctor)
        </p>
